## Startup

1. Open Visual Studio 2022 (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) or later and clone this project. Make sure you have:
   - "ASP.NET and web development" workload
   - Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Run the app (`Ctrl+F5`).

 On the first run, the build process restores npm dependencies, which can take several minutes. Subsequent builds are much faster.
